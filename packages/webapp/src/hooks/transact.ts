  // Crucially, this means that if the configuration changes, the `data` for an in-flight `write`
  // will become inaccessible. One should refrain from changing the parameters of `useWrite` until
  // the transaction has landed on-chain. However, the configuration also includes the gas price and
  // the nonce, which can be updated more frequently. I'm not really sure how this is supposed to
  // be safe (seems like a potential race condition where the config is updated before we can get
  // the data from a write), but it seems to work in practice. If not, `onSuccess` and `onError`
  // callbacks could be used to avoid the issue.

  // Because write commits to a certain nonce, `write` should only be called once per render cycle.
